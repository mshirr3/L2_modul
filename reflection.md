**getFormattedDatesWithEvents**

one of the longest funcs in module
</td>
<td align="center">

**Use Meaningful and Descriptive Names**

The naming of this function pretty much makes it self-explanatory and a comment would not be required to understand its purpose

**Seek Context in Names**

Instead of just mentioning dates, I specified formatted dates so the type of date referred to is clear.

**CustomDate**

name of a class in module
</td>
<td align="center">

**Differentiate Similar Names**

insted of calling it Date, I chose to call it CustomDate so the distinction between the two is made. The naming clearly shows that the object is custom made and not to be confused with the built in code object. This could also be an application of the "**Avoid Misleading Names**" rule
